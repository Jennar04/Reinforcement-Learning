FourRooms.py:
	
	Python code given which creates the fourRooms simulation and handles all of the methods associated with it that are needed throughout the scenarios - including graphing.


**all three scenarios are run in the following way (under deterministic actions)**
			python ScenarioX.py
	where 'X' represents the scenario number


Scenario1.py:
	
	Python code for agent to collect 1 package. Both Random and Epsilon-Greedy exploration techniques are in the code but the Random technique is commented out. 
	It is tested under deterministic by default, to make stochastic run:
			python Scenario1.py -stochastic
	

Scenario2.py:
	
	Python code for agent to collect 3 packages.
	It is tested under deterministic by default, to make stochastic run:
			python Scenario2.py -stochastic

Scenario3.py:
	
	Python code for agent to collect 3 packages in the order Red, Green then Blue.
	It is tested under deterministic by default, to make stochastic run:
			python Scenario3.py -stochastic
